# Incremental Zoning -  Website

## Overview

This website is an interactive, spatial representation of *Incremental Zoning*. Incremental Zoning is an architectural exploration that reimagines urban planning by prioritizing people's needs and desires over traditional zoning systems. The project questions fundamental assumptions about how cities, buildings, and living spaces are designed, proposing an alternative where incremental development is driven by residents rather than predetermined architectural systems.

The site uses *cursor movement* as a primary mode of navigation and interaction, allowing visitors to experience the project through motion, proximity, and discovery rather than linear scrolling or static drawings.

## Conceptual Framework

The Incremental Zoning project questions traditional top-down zoning systems and architectural authorship. Instead, it proposes a people-driven system in which:

- Zones evolve incrementally over time
- Buildings are shaped by use, desire, and adaptation
- Systems are frameworks rather than fixed outcomes

This website mirrors that philosophy by avoiding rigid navigation structures. The interface responds dynamically to the user, placing agency in the hands of the viewer, much like the project places agency in the hands of its inhabitants.

## Website Navigation System

### Cursor as an Architectural Agent

The cursor represents an active participant rather than a passive pointer. Its movement across the screen acts as a stand-in for:

- Movement through space
- Incremental decision-making
- The occupation and activation of architectural systems

As the cursor moves, elements on the page respond—revealing, shifting, or layering information.

### The Cursor as a Zoom Mechanism

The cursor-based navigation system mirrors the project's core narrative of examining architecture at multiple scales. The cursor functions as a dynamic zoom tool, allowing visitors to explore the project across three distinct architectural scales:

## Three Scales of Exploration

The project is organized around three fundamental scales, each represented by a distinct color:

### **Scale of City (1:300)** - *Red*

- Examines incremental zoning at the urban planning level
- Explores how coordinated community efforts shape cityscape development
- Demonstrates alternatives to traditional concentric zoning models

### **Scale of Building (1:50)** - *Blue*

- Investigates building-to-building relationships and the "superground"
- Explores how color coordination creates dynamic community spaces
- Analyzes the interaction between residential units and commercial/recreational zones

### **Scale of Unit (1:25)** - *Green*

- Focuses on individual living spaces and interior planning
- Examines how curtain systems allow residents to reconfigure spaces
- Questions traditional architectural planning through people-centric design

## How the Cursor Movement Works

As you move your cursor across the website:

- Horizontal movement transitions between the three scales
- Color transitions indicate which scale you're viewing
- The cursor acts as a lens through which you "zoom" into different levels of architectural detail
- This interaction embodies the project's philosophy: moving from system to people, from macro urban planning down to intimate personal spaces

The cursor system creates an immersive experience that parallels the project's methodology of examining systematic mismatches at every level of architectural design.

## Interaction Logic

Hover-based discovery:  
Content is revealed through proximity rather than clicks, encouraging exploration rather than direct instruction.

Non-linear navigation:  
There is no fixed beginning or end. Users construct their own path through the project, reflecting the open-ended nature of incremental zoning.

Spatial reading: 
Text, images, and graphical elements are positioned to be encountered, not consumed sequentially; similar to moving through a site or city.

## Intended Experience

Visitors are encouraged to:

- Move slowly and deliberately
- Allow content to emerge through exploration
- Read the website as a system rather than a document

There is no single correct way to navigate the site; this ambiguity is intentional and central to the project's thesis.

## Notes

- The website is best experienced on a desktop with a mouse or trackpad.
- Cursor-based interactions may feel unfamiliar at first; this friction reflects the project's critique of conventional systems and expectations.
- The site functions as a digital extension of the Incremental Zoning presentation, not a summary of it.
